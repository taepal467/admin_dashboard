Project using HTML and CSS Grid

- I only used CSS Grid to create the layout for the project.
- The blue morpho butterfly is the theme for this project.

## resources used
- [Animate.css](https://animate.style/) - Used this to have an animation for the Dashboard SVG image
- I used clipart images that I found through Google. The sources of the images are included in the HTML file
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - Used Font Awesome for the icons in the dashboard. 
- [Material Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/) - Used Material Icons for the images in the "Your Projects" section
